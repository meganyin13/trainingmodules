Since Java restricts generics to object and doesn't allow primitive types, at compile time, these references to generic types can be removed and cast down to an object. This is because no matter what the type is, it much be an object. However C++ does not have this restriction and does allow primitive types so it cannot just cast down to object because primitive types are not objects.
